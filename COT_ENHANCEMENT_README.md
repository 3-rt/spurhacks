# Enhanced Chain of Thought (COT) with Gemini

This system captures raw AI reasoning blocks from Stagehand and enhances them using Google's Gemini AI to create clearer, more insightful Chain of Thought statements.

## How It Works

### 1. **Raw Event Capture**
The system captures raw reasoning events from Stagehand including:
- `agent_action` - AI taking specific actions
- `agent_llm` - LLM reasoning processes  
- `agent_debug` - Debug information
- `agent_info` - General information
- `thinking_start` - Beginning of thought process
- `analyzing_request` - Request analysis
- `planning_approach` - Approach planning
- `executing_steps` - Step execution

### 2. **Event Buffering**
Raw events are collected in a buffer for 2 seconds after the last event. This allows the system to:
- Group related reasoning steps together
- Avoid processing every single event individually
- Create more coherent summaries

### 3. **Gemini Enhancement**
When the buffer is ready, the raw events are sent to Gemini with this prompt:

```
You are analyzing AI reasoning steps from a browser automation agent. Convert these raw technical logs into clear, human-readable chain of thought statements.

Please create 1-3 concise, clear statements that explain:
1. What the AI is thinking about
2. What approach it's taking  
3. What specific actions it's planning or executing

Make it conversational and easy to understand, like the AI is explaining its thought process to a human.
```

### 4. **Enhanced Display**
Enhanced events are displayed with:
- **Cyan highlighting** - Special visual treatment
- **"Enhanced by Gemini" badge** - Clear indication of enhancement
- **Confidence levels** - High/Medium/Low confidence indicators
- **Synthesis info** - Shows how many raw events were combined

## Visual Features

### Enhanced Event Styling
- **Border**: `border-cyan-400/50` with shadow
- **Background**: `bg-cyan-400/15` 
- **Icon**: Cyan-colored brain icon
- **Badge**: "Enhanced by Gemini" in cyan

### Confidence Indicators
- **High**: Green badge (`bg-green-600/20 text-green-300`)
- **Medium**: Yellow badge (`bg-yellow-600/20 text-yellow-300`) 
- **Low**: Red badge (`bg-red-600/20 text-red-300`)

### Metadata Display
- Original event count: "Synthesized from X raw reasoning steps"
- Timestamp and confidence level
- Enhanced badge for easy identification

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Set `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in your `.env` file:
```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

### Toggle Enhancement
The system includes a toggle to enable/disable enhancement:
```javascript
const [cotEnhancementEnabled, setCotEnhancementEnabled] = useState(true);
```

## Testing

### Test Functions
Two test functions are available:

1. **Regular COT Test** (âš¡ button)
   - Shows raw Stagehand events
   - Demonstrates original functionality

2. **Enhanced COT Test** (ðŸ§  button)  
   - Shows Gemini-enhanced reasoning
   - Demonstrates enhancement features

### Example Enhanced Output
Instead of raw technical logs like:
```
[agent_action] INFO: Starting browser automation
[agent_llm] modelName: gpt-4 reasoning about user request
[agent_debug] DEBUG: Parsing DOM elements
```

You get enhanced reasoning like:
```
"I'm analyzing your request to understand what you're looking for. Let me break this down into clear steps to help you effectively."
```

## Architecture

### Files Modified
- `src/services/cotEnhancementService.js` - Core enhancement logic
- `main.js` - Integration with Electron main process
- `src/components/AgentCOTStream.jsx` - UI updates and event handling

### Data Flow
1. **Stagehand** â†’ Raw reasoning events
2. **Main Process** â†’ Captures and buffers events  
3. **Enhancement Service** â†’ Processes with Gemini
4. **Frontend** â†’ Displays enhanced reasoning

### Error Handling
- Fallback to raw events if Gemini fails
- Graceful degradation without API key
- Timeout handling for API calls

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Clearer understanding** of AI reasoning
- **Reduced technical jargon** 
- **Better insight** into AI decision-making
- **More engaging** COT experience

### For Developers  
- **Modular design** - Easy to enable/disable
- **Configurable** - Adjustable buffer times and prompts
- **Extensible** - Can add other AI providers
- **Robust** - Handles failures gracefully

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **Multiple AI providers** (Claude, GPT-4, etc.)
- **Custom prompts** for different reasoning types
- **Real-time streaming** enhancement (no buffering)
- **User preferences** for enhancement style
- **Reasoning categories** (planning, execution, analysis)

### Configuration Options
- Buffer timeout adjustment
- Enhancement confidence thresholds  
- Custom Gemini prompts
- Event type filtering

This enhanced COT system transforms raw AI logs into human-readable insights, making the AI's thought process more transparent and engaging for users.
